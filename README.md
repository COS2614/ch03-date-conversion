# ch03-date-conversion
A QtWidgets Application that converts QDate objects to a QTextStream

In this program, we first create a QDate object for today's date using the QDate::currentDate() method. We then use QTextStream to display the date in various formats, including the full date, year, month (both as a number and name), day of the week (both as a number and name), and day of the year.
